## <a id="1200.10"></a>1200.10

**Release Date**: December 19, 2017

* AWS stemcells repartition to use entire root disk size as specified in BOSH cloud config.
* Stemcell adds support for multiple CPIs. You can now set `stemcell_formats` in stemcell.MF.
* Intended for use with November Microsoft security updates.
* Updated OpenSSH to 0.0.22.
* The BOSH Agent uses a lock file to ensure that DNS resolvers are updated only on first startup.

* [Bug Fix] Fixes an issue in the BOSH Agent regarding DNS resolvers that can cause application downtime when a BOSH Director is unavailable (e.g. during upgrades) when deployed on Cloud Foundry.

### Known Issues
* In the case of an empty cloud config, the Windows host DNS list will be cleared on BOSH Agent restarts.
* CIS policies break the IPsec add-on.

**Release Date**: August 22, 2017

* BOSH SSH is now supported as a beta feature. Users can enable connecting to a cmd session using the `bosh ssh` command by running the relevant job from windows-utilities-release.
